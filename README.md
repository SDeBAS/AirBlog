Frontend
1. React: React is the core library for building user interfaces in a declarative
and component-based manner. It's fundamental for developing interactive
and dynamic web applications.
2. Redux Toolkit: Redux Toolkit simplifies and streamlines the usage of
Redux in React applications. It provides a set of conventions and
abstractions that make state management more efficient and
developer-friendly.
3. axios: Axios is a widely used HTTP client library for making asynchronous
requests. It's crucial for handling data fetching and interacting with APIs in a
React application.
4. React Router: React Router enables navigation and routing in React
applications. It's essential for building single-page applications with multiple
views.
Backend
1. Express: Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for
Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web
applications by providing a set of features and middleware.
2. Mongoose: Mongoose is an ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for
MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model
application data and includes features like validation, middleware, and query
building.
3. bcryptjs: bcryptjs is a library for hashing and salting passwords. It helps
securely store and manage user passwords by providing a way to hash and
compare passwords.
4. body-parser: body-parser is middleware for Express that extracts the body
of an incoming HTTP request and parses it into a format that is easy to work
with, such as JSON or URL-encoded data.
5. cors: cors is middleware for Express that enables Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS) on the server. It allows or restricts cross-origin requests
based on the server's configuration, preventing unauthorized access.
6. dotenv: dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment
variables from a .env file into the process.env object. It's commonly used to
manage configuration settings in Node.js applications.
